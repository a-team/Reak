Smalltalk implementation running on Rubinius.

WARNING: Not usable, yet.

This implementation is not image based nor does it have a built-in IDE. So, if
you are looking for a classic Smalltalk, you might better be looking somewhere
else. Also, it is rather experimental at the moment.

Finding the right parslet revision (see Gemfile) is a bit tricky. All but the
tuning branch is way too slow, but that branch is constantly broken.

Parts of the compiler have been stolen from, I mean inspired by Brian Ford's
[Poison](https://github.com/brixen/poison).
